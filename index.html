      <p>Hello world; my name is Jeff Morgenstern. I was born and raised in Fresno California and I have 2 older brothers. My last name is of German origin. My Grandparents on my Dad's side were from Vienna, Austria. My Dad's parents came to Fresno in 1939 during World War II. My grandparents on my Mom's side were from Oklahoma, USA. My Mom's parents moved to the bay area in California around 1943 during WWII. My Mom's parents moved to Fresno, after WWII ended around 1945. All 4 of my grandparents moved to Fresno basically because of WWII. My Grandfather from Vienna, Austria started a family business here in Fresno around 1959. The business my grandfather started is a mattress manufacturing factory. I grew up working in the mattress factory since I was about 5 years old. At 5 years old I did small jobs like sweeping the floors and packaging bolts for bunk bed frames. I also went to school in Fresno but spent time working at the mattress factory off and on my whole life. My Dad and my older brother run the mattress factory currently. My dream is to start my own mattress factory like my grandfather did. I spent many years doing all the jobs in the mattress factory and I hope someday to put my skills to work again.</p>
